In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon error arises when using server components with dynamic imports within a deeply nested component structure.  The issue stems from the way Next.js resolves dependencies during the server-side rendering (SSR) process.  If a server component imports another server component dynamically (e.g., using `import()`), and this dynamic import is nested several layers deep, the path resolution might fail unpredictably. This often manifests as an error during build time or runtime where the dynamically imported component cannot be found, even if the path is correct.

Example:

```javascript
// components/A.js (Server Component)
async function A() {
  const { B } = await import('./B');
  return <B/>;
}
export default A;

// components/B.js (Server Component)
function B() {
  return <p>Component B</p>;
}
export default B;

// pages/index.js (Page Component)
function Index() {
  return <A/>
}
export default Index;
```

This simple example works fine.  However, if component `A` was nested deeper, issues may arise, especially when combined with other features like middleware or API routes.
